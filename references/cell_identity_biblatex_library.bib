Here, we develop a mathematical framework that deﬁnes this tradeoff between {mRNA}-sequencing depth and error in the extraction of biological information. We ﬁnd that transcriptional programs can be reproducibly identiﬁed at 1\% of conventional read depths. We demonstrate that this resilience to noise of ‘‘shallow’’ sequencing derives from a natural property, low dimensionality, which is a fundamental feature of gene expression data. Accordingly, our conclusions hold for \$350 single-cell and bulk gene expression datasets across yeast, mouse, and human. In total, our approach provides quantitative guidelines for the choice of sequencing depth necessary to achieve a desired level of analytical resolution. We codify these guidelines in an open-source read depth calculator. This work demonstrates that the structure inherent in biological networks can be productively exploited to increase measurement throughput, an idea that is now common in many branches of science, such as image processing.},

Here, we present {scPred}, a new generalizable method that is able to provide highly accurate classification of single cells, using a combination of unbiased feature selection from a reduced-dimension space, and machine-learning probability-based prediction method. We apply {scPred} to {scRNAseq} data from pancreatic tissue, mononuclear cells, colorectal tumor biopsies, and circulating dendritic cells and show that {scPred} is able to classify individual cells with high accuracy.

Systematic neuronal classiﬁcations for two complex basal ganglia nuclei and the striatum revealed a rare population of spiny projection neurons.

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in neural network research, as well as in many other disciplines, is ﬁnding a suitable representation of multivariate data, i.e. random vectors. For reasons of computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In other words, each component of the representation is a linear combination of the original variables. Well-known linear transformation methods include principal component analysis, factor analysis, and projection pursuit. Independent component analysis ({ICA}) is a recently developed method in which the goal is to ﬁnd a linear representation of non-Gaussian data so that the components are statistically independent, or as independent as possible. Such a representation seems to capture the essential structure of the data in many applications, including feature extraction and signal separation. In this paper, we present the basic theory and applications of {ICA}, and our recent work on the subject. ᭧ 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Independent component analysis ({ICA}) is a matrix factorization approach where the signals captured by each individual matrix factors are optimized to become as mutually independent as possible. Initially suggested for solving source blind separation problems in various ﬁelds, {ICA} was shown to be successful in analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and other types of biomedical data. In the last twenty years, {ICA} became a part of the standard machine learning toolbox, together with other matrix factorization methods such as principal component analysis ({PCA}) and non-negative matrix factorization ({NMF}). Here, we review a number of recent works where {ICA} was shown to be a useful tool for unraveling the complexity of cancer biology from the analysis of diﬀerent types of omics data, mainly collected for tumoral samples. Such works highlight the use of {ICA} in dimensionality reduction, deconvolution, data pre-processing, meta-analysis, and others applied to diﬀerent data types (transcriptome, methylome, proteome, single-cell data). We particularly focus on the technical aspects of {ICA} application in omics studies such as using diﬀerent protocols, determining the optimal number of components, assessing and improving reproducibility of the {ICA} results, and comparison with other popular matrix factorization techniques. We discuss the emerging {ICA} applications to the integrative analysis of multi-level omics datasets and introduce a conceptual view on {ICA} as a tool for deﬁning functional subsystems of a complex biological system and their interactions under various conditions. Our review is accompanied by a Jupyter notebook which illustrates the discussed concepts and provides a practical tool for applying {ICA} to the analysis of cancer omics datasets.},

	abstract = {Bridging the gap between animal or in vitro models and human disease is essential in medical research. Researchers often suggest that a biological mechanism is relevant to human cancer from the statistical association of a gene expression marker (a signature) of this mechanism, that was discovered in an experimental system, with disease outcome in humans. We examined this argument for breast cancer. Surprisingly, we found that gene expression signatures—unrelated to cancer—of the effect of postprandial laughter, of mice social defeat and of skin fibroblast localization were all significantly associated with breast cancer outcome. We next compared 47 published breast cancer outcome signatures to signatures made of random genes. Twenty-eight of them (60\%) were not significantly better outcome predictors than random signatures of identical size and 11 (23\%) were worst predictors than the median random signature. More than 90\% of random signatures .100 genes were significant outcome predictors. We next derived a metagene, called meta-{PCNA}, by selecting the 1\% genes most positively correlated with proliferation marker {PCNA} in a compendium of normal tissues expression. Adjusting breast cancer expression data for meta-{PCNA} abrogated almost entirely the outcome association of published and random signatures. We also found that, in the absence of adjustment, the hazard ratio of outcome association of a signature strongly correlated with meta-{PCNA} (R2 = 0.9). This relation also applied to single-gene expression markers. Moreover, .50\% of the breast cancer transcriptome was correlated with meta-{PCNA}. A corollary was that purging cell cycle genes out of a signature failed to rule out the confounding effect of proliferation. Hence, it is questionable to suggest that a mechanism is relevant to human breast cancer from the finding that a gene expression marker for this mechanism predicts human breast cancer outcome, because most markers do. The methods we present help to overcome this problem.},

In this paper, we use a combination of two different approaches for linear {ICA}: Comon’s information-theoretic approach and the projection pursuit approach. Using maximum entropy approximations of differential entropy, we introduce a family of new contrast (objective) functions for {ICA}. These contrast functions enable both the estimation of the whole decomposition by minimizing mutual information, and estimation of individual independent components as projection pursuit directions. The statistical properties of the estimators based on such contrast functions are analyzed under the assumption of the linear mixture model, and it is shown how to choose contrast functions that are robust and/or of minimum variance. Finally, we introduce simple ﬁxed-point algorithms for practical optimization of the contrast functions. These algorithms optimize the contrast functions very fast and reliably.},

	abstract = {Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) is widely used to profile the transcriptome of individual cells. This provides biological resolution that cannot be matched by bulk {RNA} sequencing, at the cost of increased technical noise and data complexity. The differences between {scRNA}-seq and bulk {RNA}-seq data mean that the analysis of the former cannot be performed by recycling bioinformatics pipelines for the latter. Rather, dedicated single-cell methods are required at various steps to exploit the cellular resolution while accounting for technical noise. This article describes a computational workflow for low-level analyses of {scRNA}-seq data, based primarily on software packages from the open-source Bioconductor project. It covers basic steps including quality control, data exploration and normalization, as well as more complex procedures such as cell cycle phase assignment, identification of highly variable and correlated genes, clustering into subpopulations and marker gene detection. Analyses were demonstrated on gene-level count data from several publicly available datasets involving haematopoietic stem cells, brain-derived cells, T-helper cells and mouse embryonic stem cells. This will provide a range of usage scenarios from which readers can construct their own analysis pipelines.},

We propose a novel generative approach for biclustering called ‘{FABIA}: Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition’. {FABIA} is based on a multiplicative model, which accounts for linear dependencies between gene expression and conditions, and also captures heavytailed distributions as observed in real-world transcriptomic data. The generative framework allows to utilize well-founded model selection methods and to apply Bayesian techniques.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Biclustering has become a major tool for analyzing large datasets given as matrix of samples times features and has been successfully applied in life sciences and e-commerce for drug design and recommender systems, respectively. Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition ({FABIA}), one of the most successful biclustering methods, is a generative model that represents each bicluster by two sparse membership vectors: one for the samples and one for the features. However, {FABIA} is restricted to about 20 code units because of the high computational complexity of computing the posterior. Furthermore, code units are sometimes insufﬁciently decorrelated and sample membership is difﬁcult to determine. We propose to use the recently introduced unsupervised Deep Learning approach Rectiﬁed Factor Networks ({RFNs}) to overcome the drawbacks of existing biclustering methods. {RFNs} efﬁciently construct very sparse, non-linear, high-dimensional representations of the input via their posterior means. {RFN} learning is a generalized alternating minimization algorithm based on the posterior regularization method which enforces non-negative and normalized posterior means. Each code unit represents a bicluster, where samples for which the code unit is active belong to the bicluster and features that have activating weights to the code unit belong to the bicluster.},

	title = {Empirical Bayes Matrix Factorization},
	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06931v2},
	abstract = {Matrix factorization methods – including Factor analysis ({FA}), and Principal Components Analysis ({PCA}) – are widely used for inferring and summarizing structure in multivariate data. Many matrix factorization methods exist, corresponding to diﬀerent assumptions on the elements of the underlying matrix factors. For example, many recent methods use a penalty or prior distribution to achieve sparse representations (“Sparse {FA}/{PCA}”). Here we introduce a general Empirical Bayes approach to matrix factorization ({EBMF}), whose key feature is that it uses the observed data to estimate prior distributions on matrix elements. We derive a correspondingly-general variational ﬁtting algorithm, which reduces ﬁtting {EBMF} to solving a simpler problem – the so-called “normal means” problem. We implement this general algorithm, but focus particular attention on the use of sparsity-inducing priors that are unimodal at 0. This yields a sparse {EBMF} approach – essentially a version of sparse {FA}/{PCA} – that automatically adapts the amount of sparsity to the data. We demonstrate the beneﬁts of our approach through both numerical comparisons with competing methods and through analysis of data from the {GTEx} (Genotype Tissue Expression) project on genetic associations across 44 human tissues. In numerical comparisons {EBMF} often provides more accurate inferences than other methods. In the {GTEx} data, {EBMF} identiﬁes interpretable structure that concords with known relationships among human tissues. Software implementing our approach is available at https://github.com/stephenslab/flashr.},

Although single-cell {RNA}-Seq ({scRNA}-Seq) can quantify transcripts in individual cells, each cell’s expression profile may be a mixture of both types of programs, making them difficult to disentangle. Here, we benchmark and enhance the use of matrix factorization to solve this problem. We show with simulations that a method we call consensus non-negative matrix factorization ({cNMF}) accurately infers identity and activity programs, including their relative contributions in each cell. To illustrate the insights this approach enables, we apply it to published brain organoid and visual cortex {scRNA}-Seq datasets; {cNMF} refines cell types and identifies both expected (e.g. cell cycle and hypoxia) and novel activity programs, including programs that may underlie a neurosecretory phenotype and synaptogenesis.},

	abstract = {{RNA} proﬁles are an informative phenotype of cellular and tissue states but can be costly to generate at massive scale. Here, we describe how gene expression levels can be efﬁciently acquired with random composite measurements—in which abundances are combined in a random weighted sum. We show (1) that the similarity between pairs of expression proﬁles can be approximated with very few composite measurements; (2) that by leveraging sparse, modular representations of gene expression, we can use random composite measurements to recover high-dimensional gene expression levels (with 100 times fewer measurements than genes); and (3) that it is possible to blindly recover gene expression from composite measurements, even without access to training data. Our results suggest new compressive modalities as a foundation for massive scaling in high-throughput measurements and new insights into the interpretation of high-dimensional data.},

	abstract = {Sparse coding—that is, modelling data vectors as sparse linear combinations of basis elements—is widely used in machine learning, neuroscience, signal processing, and statistics. This paper focuses on the large-scale matrix factorization problem that consists of learning the basis set in order to adapt it to speciﬁc data. Variations of this problem include dictionary learning in signal processing, non-negative matrix factorization and sparse principal component analysis. In this paper, we propose to address these tasks with a new online optimization algorithm, based on stochastic approximations, which scales up gracefully to large data sets with millions of training samples, and extends naturally to various matrix factorization formulations, making it suitable for a wide range of learning problems. A proof of convergence is presented, along with experiments with natural images and genomic data demonstrating that it leads to state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed and optimization for both small and large data sets.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The development of high-throughput single-cell sequencing technologies now allows the investigation of the population diversity of cellular transcriptomes. The expression dynamics (gene-to-gene variability) can be quantiﬁed more accurately, thanks to the measurement of lowly expressed genes. In addition, the cell-to-cell variability is high, with a low proportion of cells expressing the same genes at the same time/level. Those emerging patterns appear to be very challenging from the statistical point of view, especially to represent a summarized view of singlecell expression data. Principal component analysis ({PCA}) is a most powerful tool for high dimensional data representation, by searching for latent directions catching the most variability in the data. Unfortunately, classical {PCA} is based on Euclidean distance and projections that poorly work in presence of over-dispersed count data with dropout events like single-cell expression data.},
